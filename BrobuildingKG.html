            	<h1> Kai Greene </h1>
                <p>
                	Kai Greene is my favourite bodybuilder. He is a mass monster. Not only is he huge but he is also extremely entertaining, this is because of his skills as a poser. In my opinion he  					is the best poser this world has ever seen. One of his signature poses is <i> The Dirty Diana </i> which is amazing. Although being an extremely skilled poser Kai has never won  		 					the Olympia title, which is a shame because of the simple fact that he is definently one of the best bodybuilders of our time. 
                </p>
                <p>
                	Kai had a troubled youth, being institutionalized after his mother abandoned him at the age of 14. Bodybuilding saved him, It was one of his teachers that introduced him to  		 					bodybuilding when he showed Kai the movie <i> Pumping Iron </i> He quickly found a passion for the sport and has loved it every since. Today Kai is not competing. The reason for   					this is still unknown, it might be because of the political aspect of bodybuilding, which seems to be against Kai. However I hope he does go back to competing and wins an MR  			 					Olympia title.
