                	<p>
                    	Ronnie Coleman, as mentioned earlier, has the most Mr Olympia wins (shared with Lee Haney) of any bodybuilder. Ronnie was not only crazy big, he was also insanely strong. He   						could squat and deadlift 800 pounds and bench 500 pounds for reps. This just shows his dedication to the gym. Ronnie worked out at Metroflex gym, Arlington, Texas. Many   		 						bodybuilders have claimed that the gym he worked out at was not a good one. But since Coleman was so dedicated and had the right mindset he was able to become the best. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    	At the peak of Ronnies career no one could beat him even on their best day. He was truly a freak beast. The reason Ronnie did not win more Olympias was because of old age. Jay  						Cutler, Ronnie's rival, confirmed this in an interview. Sadly Ronnie lost the ability to walk for a couple of months as a result of multiple back surgeries. That did not stop  						him from working out though. Today he is able to walk once again and is still going hard in the gym.
