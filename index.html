                    	Hello and welcome to my fanpage! This webpage is dedicated to displaying my three favourite bodybuilders, Arnold Schwarzenegger, Ronnie Coleman and Kai Greene. On this website 						I will write about those three bodybuilders as well as talking about why they are my top three. Other than that i will also show their workout- and diet-plan. I hope you will 				 						enjoy my page and learn something at the same time!

                    	Arnold is probably the most famous bodybuilder in the world. This is most likely because he was the first to really talk about the sport. The bodybuilders prior to him were  	 						very shy and did not like to talk to the media. Arnold said this in the bodybuildingdocumentary <i> Pumping Iron </i>, which also contributed to his fame. Except for bringing  						attention to Arnold, <i> Pumping Iron </i> brought attention to the bodybuilding sport. How ever bodybuilding is not only a sport, it is also a lifestyle, an art and also an  		 						entertainment.

                    	While Arnold Schwarzenegger is the most famous Ronnie Coleman is considered by many as the world's best. Since bodybuilding is a subjective sport, there is no one who is the  		 						factually best. Coleman has the most MR Olympa titles won (8), shared with Lee Haney. The Olympia contest is the most prestigeous competition within bodybuilding, where only   						the best of the best are able to qualify. There are only 15-20 competitors each year in the Olympia and to just qualify makes you a champion. 
                    </p>

                    	Kai Greene, even though not having any MR Olympia titles won is my favourite bodybuilder and is also considered to be one of the best of our time. He has been the runner up in  						the Olympia several times though. He has chosen to not compete in the competition since the year 2014. The reason behind this is still unclear. The bodybuilder is certainly   			 						one of a kind. Arnold Schwarxenegger has even said that Greene is the best poser he has ever seen.
