            	<h1> Kai's Workout and Diet plan </h1>
                <p>
                	Kai's workout has 2 rest days. He only trains each muscle group once a week. day 1 is chest, day 2 arms and forearms, day 3 legs, day 4 back, day 5 is shoulders and day 6 and 7   				 					are rest days. His workout routine is very similar to Ronnie Coleman's in the sense that he has 2 rest days. 
                </p>
                <p>
                	Kai's diet plan contains 5 meals, one being a protein shake. Kai is a big bodybuilder, so if you also want to get big i would recommend following this diet and workout routine.
                </p> 
                <p>
                	His full diet and workout routine can be found to your right.
