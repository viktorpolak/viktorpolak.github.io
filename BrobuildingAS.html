            	<h1> Arnold Schwarzenegger </h1>
                <p>
                	The most famous bodybuilder in the world. Arnold has during his lifetime not only been active within the sport but is also a well known actor and politician. He is mostly known  	 					for his role in the <i> Terminator </i> franchise as <i> The Terminator </i> himself. Schwarzenegger is still an fairly active actor, who is still acting in movies in the year  		 					2017. Except for his acting career Arnold is also politically engaged. He is currently batteling <i> Gerrymandering </i> which is a political term meaning candidates running for   					office is able to manipulate district boundaries, giving them an advantage in the election. Schwarenegger was the Governor of California for 2003 to 2011. He has in other word   	 					conquered the bodybuilding world, acting world and also the political world, which is very impressive considering conquering only one of these is its own challenge.

                	Arnold has been and still is an inspiration to pretty much every bodybuilder after him. Arnold was before his bodybuilding career a powerlifter, but later started to focus on    	 					bodybuilding. Many say that it was his dedication that made him the best. While working out he only thought about working out and nothing else. This helped improve his muscles  			 					further than any other bodybuilder. Some might argue that it was steroids that made him the best, but a big misconception about steroids is that they just give you muscle out of   					nowhere. This is of course false. You have to work hard in order to gain big muscle mass, steroids simply allow you to get bigger faster. Another misconeption about steroids is  	 					that anyone can get huge if they are on steroids. This is also false, you have to work hard, eat right and have insanely high discipline to get the body of a bodybuilder.
