                <p>
                	To get big you have to eat big. This is exactly what Ronnie Coleman did. He ate over 5500 calories a day, 150g of fats, 546g of protein and 474g of carbs. Big Ron got this   		 					nickname for a reason. It takes a lot of dicipline to be able to get this intake of calories every day, a very few selection of people are able to do it and even less people can   					do it only eating lean food. 
                </p>
                <p>
                	Ronnie's get big workout has 2 rest days. This is probably because of the intesity of his workout plan, which features a lot of exercises for each gym session. As you may know  		 					rest and sleep is one of the pillars of getting big and that is why 2 rest days are essential. 
                </p>
                <p>
                	His workout and diet can be found to your right.
