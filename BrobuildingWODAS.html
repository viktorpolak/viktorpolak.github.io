            	<h1> Arnold's Workout and Diet plan </h1>
                <p>
                	Arnold's workout routine for mass was very simple, every muslce group twice a week (except for abs which he did every day) and only 1-5 exercises per muscle group. Day one was  					  					chest and back. Day two shoulders, biceps, triceps and forearms. Day three legs and calves. Then it repeats with day seven being a rest day. 
                </p>
                <p> 
                	Arnold had five meals a day. What you have to think about if you decide to use his diet is that you might not need the same amount of calories as him. Arnold recommended that you  					get 1 gram of protein for every pound of bodyweight. If you follow his dietplan you should have no problem doing this. 
                </p>
                <p>
                	To your right you can find a link to Arnold's blueprint to mass, both his workout and dietplan.
